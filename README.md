# CollectionViewAnimations

Sample project demonstrating how to expand / collapse collection view cells using custom animation blocks.

## Description

Collection views are very powerful, but can be cumbersome as well. This sample project was put together to demonstrate how collection view cells can be animated using the typical `UIView.animateWithDuration` methods alongside a custom `UICollectionViewLayout`.

> This is merely for example purposes to demonstrate one way to animate layout changes using `UIView.animateWithDuration`. Please be cautious about using any of this logic in production code.
